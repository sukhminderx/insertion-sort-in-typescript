# Insertion Sort
## comparison sort
## works best if list is already almost sorted
## each iteration removes an el from list and inserts it at correct position in already sorted list
## in-place
## after every k-th iteration, first k+1-th els are sorted

# take an el, loop to compare with prev and swap if needed
# if that el is in prev, then prev=prev-- and compare aain, ie, compare with more previous

# pseudo code
## iterate from 1st index
## in each iteration, compare n-pass el with previous els and put the el to the correct position in the list
